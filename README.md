"Social Emotion Prediction" focuses on the task of predicting the emotions of readers when they are exposed to a text, referred to as social emotion prediction. This field is an extension of sentiment analysis, going beyond simple positive, negative, or neutral classifications to understand deeper emotional impacts of texts on readers.

Social emotion differs from the emotion expressed by the text's writer, as it reflects the collective emotional response of the audience to the content. The task involves identifying which emotions a text is likely to provoke in its readers, considering that these responses can be influenced by individual backgrounds and personal experiences, which are often unknown.
